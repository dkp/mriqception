# Features to add / future goals

Things we'd potentially like to do, but won't get to this week.

_*Ideas*_:

* Create a better user interface.
* Display "normative" datapoints colored by crowdsourced ratings for that image (_Exclude, Poor, Acceptable, Excellent_), if available from the web API.
* Ability to automatically get relevant acquisition parameters from the BIDS dataset JSON files and plug them into the web API query, rather than the user having to manually input them.
* Query web API by additional conditions and combinations of parameters (currently only works with a limited number of search conditions).
* Integrate with <a href="https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc">MRIQC</a> group HTML reports?

* _Probably not feasible given that MRIQC doesn't have or push this information afaik but it would be nice to be able to look at web API data from only certain populations, i.e., child or clinical samples, which may have different ranges of "normative" values for certain IQMs (i.e., those impacted by motion)._
